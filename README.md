# 🧠⚖️ Forensics, Criminology & Human‑Centered Technology

> *A living laboratory where code meets courts, maps meet minds, and data tells human stories.*

## 🎯 Why This Repository Exists

This repository is not a collection of random projects.

It exists because I am deeply interested in **merging technology with human sciences** — particularly **forensics, criminology, psychology, law, and ethics**.

As a B.Tech Information Technology student with strong interests in **criminology, forensic science, and human behavior**, I use code as a *lens*:

* to **understand crime**, not just predict it
* to **visualize injustice**, not just chart numbers
* to **design systems that respect humans**, not replace them

Many projects here are:

* exploratory rather than “production-ready”
* intentionally opinionated in design
* grounded in real forensic workflows (courts, investigations, evidence handling)

This repository acts as:

* a **portfolio of thought**
* a **research playground**
* a **record of learning and iteration**

## 🧭 How to Navigate This Repository

Each **top-level directory** represents a *domain of inquiry*.
Each **sub-project** inside has its **own README** explaining:

* the idea
* methodology
* limitations
* how to run it

> 📎 **Important:** Please refer to the `README.md` inside each project folder for detailed documentation.

## 🔬 Major Project Themes (What You’ll Find Here)

### 🧠 AI & Reasoning in Forensics

* NeuroLex (EEG + explainable AI for court contexts)
* AI personas for forensic education
* Local LLMs (Ollama) for explainable forensic narratives

### 🗺️ GIS & Crime Mapping

* QGIS‑based district‑level crime analysis
* Python pipelines replacing manual GIS repetition
* Explicit handling of IPC schema changes and data ethics

### 📊 Dashboards for Awareness & Investigation

* Public‑facing crime awareness dashboards
* Restricted forensic / investigator‑mode analytics
* Narrative‑driven data storytelling

### 🧾 Evidence Management & Integrity

* Chain‑of‑custody simulations
* Tamper detection in medical & digital evidence
* Human‑centered EMS designs

### 🔐 Authentication & Behavioral Biometrics
* Graphical password systems beyond text-based authentication
* Mouse dynamics and behavioral signatures as a second factor
* Explainable AI for trust and transparency in security decisions
* **BioGraph Auth** — A research prototype for graphical authentication enhanced with behavioral biometrics and explainable AI, exploring how *how* a user authenticates can be as important as *what* they know.


### 🤖 Machine Learning in Crime Systems

* Crime rate prediction
* Network anomaly detection
* Face‑based suspect detection (with ethical notes)

### 🧪 Simulations & Experiments

* Bias detection systems
* Criminology‑inspired OS & decision simulators

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

Some intentional choices you’ll notice:

* **Readable over clever** → clarity matters in courts
* **Explainability over accuracy** → trust beats black boxes
* **Human‑centered UI** → investigators are humans, not CPUs
* **Ethical disclaimers included** → especially for AI & ML work

Many projects explicitly document:

* what *should not* be deployed
* what is *only educational*
* where data or models may mislead

## 🧩 Final Note

This repository will continue to evolve.

Some projects may remain unfinished by design — because asking the *right questions* often matters more than shipping polished answers.

If you are a student, researcher, or practitioner interested in **crime, forensics, security, or human‑centered systems**, feel free to explore, critique, and build upon this work.
